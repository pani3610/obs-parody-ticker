+ [x] OBS Text(FreeType2) has a size limitation. It seems that if ticker size goes above a certain threshold, it does not display it in OBS.
    + __Its not specific to FreeType2. Any OBS source when rendered if crosses the width limit of 16380 its not rendered. This is irrespective of Video Output Resolution__
        + To check width in OBS, Right click > Transform > Edit Transform. Here you will find the size of any source.
    + Max-width of texttype2 depends on ~~font, font-size~~ OBS Source size. Max-width for current selection (Roboto,Mono,22) is 1260.
    + When the file is rewritten the start of the file moves if the length of text changes.
    + [ ] Windows supports TextGDI+ which is supposed to be different than freetype. Not available in Mac. To be checked on windows machine.
+ [x] Does changing font type affect the cpv and thereby cps?
    + cpv : characters per viewport.
            since size of viewport is fixed at X pixels and character size depends on font, YES it will affect.
    + cps : characters per second.
            text speed depends on OBS filter scroll speed which is pixel/second. Since character width depends on font it YES it will affect. 
+ [x] The width of all characters in a font is not the same. Calculate the no of blank space for a clean slate frame of ticker.
    ~~__Workaround: Use Monospace fonts.__ Currently using Roboto Mono.~~
    + Since switch time is being decided on pixel count any font can be chosen.
+ [x] Make file location fetching cross platform and location agnostic.
+ [ ] One feed will have different padding based on different tickers. One ticker can have multiple feeds.
+ [ ] How to define an attribute for the feed based on the ticker. I want to set the padding of feed based on ticker. But the same feed is used by another ticker it will overwrite the first ticker's padding. Since the Ticker class can't hold the state of a feed class without making it the attribute of ticker.
+ [x] The ticker restarts from the beginning when transitioned from a scene not having a ticker.  
    Run code on scene Transition  
    + [x] Start code when transitioning to scene with ticker
    + [x] Stop code when transitioning to scene without ticker  
    OR  
    + [ ] Add ticker to all scenes and hide where not required. Open OBS and main.py together.
+ [ ] Some parody headlines don't make sense without reading the article and getting the context. 
+ [x] ~~Make the Feed class take argument of url as input and the rest as **kw.~~ use parameter name wherever required.
+ [ ] Refine OOP.
    + [ ] Convert to staticmethod or classmethod wherever required.
+ [x] Calculate relation between text_speed and FONT and OBS_SCROLL_SPEED
    + text_speed (characters per second) = OBS_SCROLL_SPEED/FONT-WIDTH
+ [x] Find out ways to dynamically update feed text when the courtesy text or the separator text or the number of headlines change.
    + Changed structure of Feed and Feed text. 
    + Realised python takes Object arguments by reference and not by value i.e.
    ```python
    class A:
    def __init__(self):
        self.x = 12
        self.y = 24
        self.z = 32

    class B:
        def __init__(self,a:A):
            self.a = a
            self.b =13

    example_A = A()
    example_B = B(example_A)
    example_B.a.z=77
    print(example_A.z)#will return 77
    ```
+ [x] Automatically reset the feed text if it goes above the ticker max length.
+ [x] End the program gracefully.
+ [x] Add feedback to switch feed on receiving some kind of feedback from OBS.
    + [ ] CV2 OBS Virtual Cam approach:
        + [ ] Reduce video input processed so as to actually reduce processing work.  
            + [ ] Reduce fps
            + [ ] Reduce resolution
            + [ ] make grayscale
+ [x] Optimise performance.
    + Python is slow. But there surely is scope for optimisation.
    + Using timeit to measure the execution time shows the main.py takes around 2 seconds to run on average.
    + exectime.py creates a report to diagnose the per function call performance. Run the following after executing exectime.py
        ```bash
        snakeviz ./filename.prof
        ```
    + __Analyzing the data shows that over 95% execution time is for the http calls to retrieve rss feeds which is executed by the library. Not much scope of improvement in user-written code.__

+ [ ] If execution time cannot be predicted correctly, atleast it can be made consistent by ensuring the code executes exactly at let say 7 seconds by padding the program execution time.

+ [x] Add feeds to ticker concurrently.
    + 4x faster than sequential. Refer threadresult.txt

+ [x] We know when we switch from a non-ticker scene to a ticker scene, the ticker is refreshed i.e. The ticker starts from the beginning. Using websocket, we can identify when we switch from a non-ticker scene to a ticker scene and then run main.py.
    + [x] To be specific we build a ticker and wait. Then we switch scene and then start the ticker.
    + [x] When we switch to a non-ticker scene we must ~~kill main.py~~ stop ticker to be resumed later.
    + [ ] The TransitionBegin event isn't called while the program is within the while loop of ticker.start whereas it does work when its main.py sleep. How does it differentiates between different sleeps?
    + [x] Typically there is no need to switch from TheStart to any other scene more than once and its done only at the beginning. But eventually if a scene is added that doesn't have the ticker and to switch back to a ticker scene, the ticker must be restarted.
    + [x] Instead of checking scenes by name, check whether they contain the ticker or not. And the scene they are switching to has ticker or not. Based on that start or stop the ticker. Another check whether the ticker is rendered or not even if its present in a scene.
    + [x] Basically, add a stop feature in ticker. And when start is called again, restart the ticker.
    + [x] Instead of checking scenes by name, check whether they contain the ticker or not. And the scene they are switching to has ticker or not. Based on that start or stop the ticker.
    + [x] Basically, add a stop feature in ticker. And when start is called again, restart the ticker.
+ [x] Run main.py of master branch whenever obs is run.
    + ~~Achieved externally through Shortcuts app on Mac.~~
+ [ ] OBS allows to run python from its Scripts tool. Try to integrate this as a obsscript. [Details here](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/Getting-Started-With-OBS-Scripting)
    + [ ] It lets you provide inputs via GUI component. It can be used to provide options. Some feasible options maybe:
        + [ ] Tickbox list of feed sources
        + [ ] Name and url prompt to add your own feed sources.
        + [ ] Slider to control scroll speed
        + [ ] Font selection
        + [ ] Checkbox of all scenes where to add the ticker
        + [ ] Time between 2 feeds
        + [ ] Text direction
        + [ ] Start and Stop button
    + [ ] Also provides support for callback functions on events without websockets. To be integrated if feasible python-script possible.
    + [ ] It doesn't seem to support venv of Python3.9. The docs say in windows it supports 3.6. venv doesn't allow making environments of different versions.
        + Installing virtualenv which allows this feature but requires installation path to the version required, which means one has to install manually the version required.
        + [ ] '$ brew install python3.6' or @3.6/3.7 throws error. Installing .pkg from python.org.[This post](https://obsproject.com/forum/threads/python-scripts-on-mac.121235/post-462492) provides hint as to which installation folder path is to be provided. __This has not worked for me. I have replied to the author of the post. I have raised this query on the OBS discord server with no satisfactory answer.__ ___Pausing this for now___ [Continue here](https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/wiki/Scripting-Tutorial-Source-Shake) when solution found.
+ [x] Quit main.py when OBS is closed.
    + Add a hook to detect OBS exit.
    + Add a obs quit event and make it wait for hook. As the hook is activated, the event is set and main.py is closed.
+ [ ] When the transition isn't complete and we switch scene again, it raises an error and exits ticker.
+ [ ] Add logging to the project instead of using print statements.
+ [x] Import feed logo from feed website.
    + [x] Get image URL
    + [x] Download and ~~resize to 38x38~~ ~~OBS takes care of resizing.~~ but OBS doesn't care about alignment so standardizing size.
    + [x] Retain option to provide local file as feed logo
+ [ ] Feed Last updated date exception handling
+ [ ] Windows testing
    + [x] Replace FreeTypeText with TextGDI+
        + TextGDI+ also has an upper limit based on font size and file size. Now I understand the purpose of GDI and FreeType is to 'render' text to graphics so naturally they have to have a limit.
        + Emojis don't work when tested. ðŸ˜€ gives ðŸ–¾ even in GDI+. It works only on one font Segoe UI Emoji but there the emojis are colorless and ðŸ‡®ðŸ‡³ renders as IN.
    + [x] Install python and check obsscript  
        + When python installed path is provided the scripts are __working__. OBS-Script on the works for sure.
        + [ ] Change from websocket to intrisic implementation
    + [x] Exception handling for Pillow.Image.open() on windows. This is not expected to happen. There is no such error thrown on Mac.
        + Replacing ```except:``` with ```except Exception:``` does the trick.
+ [x] Kill orphan threads when starting and stopping ticker.
+ [ ] Add ticker OBS source dynamically and integrate with OBS source. Set its height width position based on OBS settings of resolution etc. Make all of this part of ticker class.
    + [ ] Set scroll speed multiple of single character length
    + Source settings and source properties both can be manipulated from the websocket.
    + GetTextFreetype2Properties and GetSourceSettings give the same results. Better to use GetSourceSettings for settings and GetSceneItemProperties to get properties.
    + Source width and height cannot be changed through SetSceneItemProperties. Use SetSceneItemTransform.
    + [x] calculate switching time based on pixel count rather than character count.
    + [ ] Check if scene has Ticker Source. If not import from a JSON file.
    + [ ] If found, set the source settings (font,text etc.)
    + [x] When switching ticker,update textfile and get the size of the rendered OBS source and calculate the switchToNextFeed time based on it.
    + [ ] Remove padding text. Add padding in terms of sleep.
+ [x] Since image is already stored as a feed attribute why store it as a file as well? Instead write to container from feedLogo data.
+ [x] Erratic values of single space width when ran. Expected value 13. The pixel widths of feeds incorrects as well

        but error persists. Every run of program gives different values for different variables.
    + Adding sleep after file-writes is mitigating some errors.
    + [x] Try to get feedback from OBS when text updated.
        + Transform changes when tickertext sourcewidth is updated. Can be used to wait for file-write to complete.
        + The ```SceneItemTransformChanged``` event is triggered multiple times when tickertext updated once. Items other than tickertext are also _transformed_.
            + when tickertext updated; tickertext, white-bg, News-logo, ticker-tape, tickertext, TIcker-tape all are updated.
            + __tickertext updated twice__
            + Since parent is updated only once, it can be attached to update event.
                + [x] But if any other item is changed it will also trigger the parent.
                    + Added extra flag to check when text has to be updated.
            + [ ] If text is updated and its the same text does it still trigger the event?
                + No the event is NOT triggered and the program is stalled.
                + In fact, even if you change the text but the rendered source size remains the same, the event isn't triggered.
                + If timeout is provided it leads to delay and puts feed-switch out of sync.
                + When updating the file with text of same size which is being rendered in Monospace font, sometimes timeout is reached and sometimes event is triggered before timeout
                    + For character pairs like O and I, the textchange event is triggered, even though there is no change in sourceWidth.
                    + For character pairs like F and D, timeout is reached everytime.
            
            + Tests give 'Not match' when scene transitioned
    + [x] SSW value now consistent and accurate but headlines count is still behaving erratic. Optimise reducing headline count.
        + Get headlines count from binary search
+ [ ] Add progress-bar for ticker switch.
+ [ ] Add GUI Element to set ticker properties before start
    + [ ] Show Sample ticker while tinkering with GUI elements. Update dynamically
+ [ ] Catch errors when no internet connection
+ [ ] Session must be outside ticker and not other way round. Maybe one OBS session can have multiple tickers with their own set of threads and events.
    + Maybe another class above Ticker required to connect to OBS. Like Session > Ticker > Websocket. This way one OBS session can have multiple Tickers with different OBS Source names.
+ [ ] As padding is now added in ticker textcontainer instead of feed text and same is planned in context of image resize of Feed logo, updating headlines should not change the original headlines count. This way the same feed can be re-used in another ticker.
+ [ ] Create OBS Ticker source from code. Store preloaded settings in Json file to be retrieved and create source.
    + If sourcename already exists, properties aren't changed. One has to delete the source a create a new source.
    + Order : Strip >> Text >> Logo >> White-Circle
    + Alignment of sources must be as requirement:
        + Text,Strip : Center-left (1)
        + Logo,WhiteCircle : Center (0)
    + [ ] Lock the sources by default.
    + [ ] Create a source-group.
    + [x] Tickertext
        + Properties : only position needs to be calculated and changed after creation. The rest value are all defaults.
        + Settings : provided during creating source.
        + Filters
    + [x] News logo
    + [x] Ticker-graphics
        + [ ] Set white strip length based on viewport width and height based on font size.
        + [ ] Set white circle size based on image size.
        + [ ] __A _CSS_ file must be maintained for ticker-graphics__
    + [x] Currently source names are hard-coded. Import values from created object.
+ [ ] Name all the threads wherever created.
+ [x] Accomodate for negative scroll value.
+ [ ] Add multiple feeds from within ticker.
+ [ ] Update feeds within ticker.
+ [x] There is significant creep at high scroll speeds. Calculate time difference between text container update and switch next feed loop.
    + Calculated time is significant. Always greater than 1 second and average 2 seconds.
    + Feed update time measured and removed from wait time removes creep but is not perfect. Empty time of 1 seconds advised.
+ [x] Instead of having the ticker with loop setting on and switching feed by program, we can uncheck the loop condition and re-render the tickertext at the end of a feed. This will ensure there is no creep visible.
    + TransformChange doesn't detect visibility change but it has its own event.
+ [x] OBS quit event isn't working as desired. How does python set priorities in case of several events?
    + Set other events before setting the quit event. Works as desired.
    + When program waiting for one event, maybe it doesn't affect it if other events are set.
+ [ ] Set scroll speed to 0 when configuring and doing calculations in ticker.start()
    + Currently hiding scroll filter when configuring feeds in ticker.start()
+ [ ] In case ticker stopped or disconnected,set loop of tickertext to true so that it can loop through the final feed sent before disconnect again and again.
+ [x] Rectify ReduceHeadlinesCount to never cross maxlimit.

    The Onion 23283
    for The Onion: Feed text too large. Reducing number of headlines. Original Headline Count : 25
    Headline count: 13|Pixel Width: 12792
    Headline count: 19|Pixel Width: 17875
    Headline count: 16|Pixel Width: 15574
    Headline count: 17|Pixel Width: 16107
    Headline count: 18|Pixel Width: 17121
    Final headline count:18| 17121 pixels
    ```
    + The headline reduce function was running one loop less than safely required. Happened because of difference of 1 between traditional index of list and headline count.
    + Function modified from binary search to proportional search
+ [ ] Update text container and image container in parallel.
    + Currently image container updated takes less than 1 millisecond so no point making it a priority.
+ [x] Store feed objects locally to test and not fetch again and again while testing.
    + Why don't I learn yield and generators and iterators seriously??!
+ [ ] Why add spaces to the file for padding? Either add 1.25 of viewport width and add time delay. this way no need do monkey-balancing with negative scroll.
+ [x] No need to disable scroll for doing all the calculation and checks. Checks are valid even if the source is hidden.
    + No need to refreshSource if loop condition in scroll filter is true.
    + [ ] Create a separate clone source and do all the calculation before and delete it.
+ [x] Create a generic waitforupdate function
+ [x] Create common settings JSON file for all sources
+ [ ] graphics are being created of double size.
+ [x] Create a OBSSource class.
+ [x] Hide OBSSource while creating and setting up.
+ [ ] Handle setup when sources already created and needs update.
+ [x] Jitters are visible where there is a difference between size of feeds is significantly different.
    + [x] Remove Loop from scroll filter.
    + [ ] if text direction is mirrored. change the
        + [ ] alignment of TICKER to 2
        + [ ] position of TICKER,LOGO,CIRCLE
    + [x] When ticker stopped or disconnected enable loop from scroll filter.
+ [x] Logo not updating when running from main.py
    + When saving file when fetching, the images are correctly fetched.
    + __In main.py, imagecontainer is provided as parameter wrapped with abs_path. In ticker.updateImageContainer(), imagecontainer is wrapped again in abs_path.__
    + [x] Rectify abs_path to handle all situations.
        + If folder doesn't exist, create folders recursively.
        + Identify if provided string is absolute path or relative path.
